# TS Lox

A TypeScript Implementation of [Lox programming language](https://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) by Robert Nystrom.
What's unique about this is that you can define your own keywords.
On the demo site, I've defined *Nepali* keywords; on the custom tab, you can update the keywords to your liking. 

Try it and let me know what you think about this project.
